# Covid-animated-d3
A moving bar graph that shows how covid deaths are reported with a delay.

I made this project to show how covid-19 deaths are often reported much after they happen, which makes the graph misleading, because it shows a greater downward trend then there actually is. Newly reported deaths show up in yellow, and become darker as time passes, so you can see when they were reported. The x axis is the date of death, and the date of reporting is shown on top. All the data comes from the AZDHS data dashboard, which was recorded daily to track reporting delays. Much thanks to my dad Andy Flach (@AndyfromTucson on twitter) for recording the data! 

NOTE: this worked great when I made it, because it was only one month of data. However, almost four months of data is not appreciated by my computer. It still works, but will sometimes freeze or glitch.  Maybe in the future I will try to redo this to make it more efficient, but I don't really have a need for this project anymore
